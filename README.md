Generative AI applied to audio and image content generation. Content aimed at newly graduates focusing on trainee and junior positions.

AIs and editor used:

ElevenLabs: text to speech for the podcast audio. V3(alpha) version was used.

ChatGPT: used to generate the podcast name, script and name of presenter.

Leonardo AI: Since Midjourney, the recomended AI for the cover generation, has ended its free trial
            as of 28/09/2025, Leonardo AI was used instead for this pourpose.

CAPCUT: used to merge the assets in one video.

           to conform to ElevenLabs restriction of tokens/generation.
